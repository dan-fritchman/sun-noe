## Is This Secure?

I think so.
It's not really my area of expertise.
My area of expertise is really limited to eating pizza.

Any links to the underlying spreadsheets are secured in Heroku's secret variables.
Are your cell number and email safe in that spreadsheet?
Or are you going to start getting spam, get your identity stolen, or have some other major problem?

Probably not as safe as if you, say, kept them hidden under your bed.
But yeah, safe.

Either way - don't put your credit card, social security number, or any other high-risk stuff in here.
